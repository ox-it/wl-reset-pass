		<subject> Welcome To ${localSakaiName}!</subject>
		<message>${addedBy} (${addedByEmail}) has invited you to join the ${memberSites} site on Vula.

Accept this invitation ${url}

What is Vula?
Vula is the University of Cape Town’s web-based content management system. It is home to many course sites, as well as a host of other sites including those used for administration, research and project groups, libraries and student societies. As a guest user, you have been invited to join a Vula site. On the site you will have rights to read content but you also may be able to create and/or edit content (depending on your assigned role).

What if I already have a Vula account?
If you have used Vula in the past then you already have a Vula account, in
which case we strongly suggest that you accept the above invitation and then
indicate which existing Vula account you wish to use to access this site. This
will avoid you having multiple accounts, each with a different set of
associated sites. If you do not choose to associate this site with an existing
account, a new guest account will be created for you using this email
address. And in the future to access the site you must login to Vula using the
guest account username and its associated password.</message>
